# BDD - Java / Selenium / Cucumber
**BDD** (Behavior-Driven Development) is an extension of **TDD** (Test-Driven Development) that emphasizes developing features based on a user story and writing code that provides a solution to real problems. In this project, I would like to share some basic exercises of BDD in testing using [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java), [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver) and [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber) framework, that I did during the comprehensive software testing course by [Software Development Academy](https://sdacademy.pl), which I completed in 2021.
